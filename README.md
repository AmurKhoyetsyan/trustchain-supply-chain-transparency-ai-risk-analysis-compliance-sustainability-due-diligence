# Trustchain

**Trustchain** is a smart digital tool that helps companies better understand and manage their supply chains.  
Built with the help of **artificial intelligence**, Trustchain makes it easy for businesses to:

- Collaborate closely with suppliers
- Stay compliant with laws (e.g., the **German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act**)
- Spot risks such as environmental harm or human rights issues
- Track and report supply chain performance with customization

With its intuitive design and powerful insights, Trustchain supports more transparent, responsible, and sustainable operations—turning complex supply chain challenges into clear, manageable actions.
